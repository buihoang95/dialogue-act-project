from uh from:::stalling
it seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word still you have to deal with the people that happen to be operating it locally:::inform
uh:::stalling
right:::autoPositive
uh:::stalling
you know:::stalling
and:::turnKeep
uh:::stalling
it's just a matter of trust you know:::inform

so it's difficult for them:::inform
well:::turnTake
we certainly found that to be true:::agreement
huh-uh:::autoPositive
uh:::stalling

if we can call those chain kind of things like that uh by that name:::Inform

uh:::stalling
at one point in time we've had au pairs:::inform
huh-uh:::autoPositive
by trading services with them:::inform

and:::turnKeep
that worked for a while:::inform
but adequate ones were really tough to find:::inform

and:::turnKeep
uh:::stalling
she was paid very well because the parents trusted them:::inform
they the parents:::selfCorrection
and:::turnKeep
they had done such a good job:::inform

much as other cultures disagree our lives don't revolve around our children:::inform
yeah:::autoPositive
yeah:::autoPositive
and:::turnKeep
that's bad to have to admit too:::inform
that's that's that's:::stalling
but it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home:::inform
uh you know:::stalling
and and:::stalling
i think that is one reason why i continue to be without children:::inform
i:::retraction
it's just such a responsibility:::inform
and and:::stalling

it's its:::stalling
it's just the way your attitude changes:::inform
and:::turnKeep
you mature i suppose:::inform
but the thing about the child care i have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work:::inform
i you know i:::stalling
and and:::stalling
it's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he as well:::inform
uh:::stalling
but you know  they need the money:::inform
and when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else it's just i can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care:::inform
uh:::stalling
and and you know:::stalling
um:::stalling
it's just a scary thing:::inform

i think that might be part of the problem with some people you know:::inform
taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing:::inform
but when you have them in their little feet are moving:::inform
